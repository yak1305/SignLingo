SignLingo

This Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect sign language gestures in real-time. The detected gestures are automatically translated into text, which can then be converted into speech in various languages. The application offers a seamless and intuitive experience for communicating across different languages through sign language.

->Features:

1) Real-Time Gesture Detection: Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and recognize sign language gestures.

 
2) Automatic Text Conversion: Converts recognized gestures into corresponding text without the need for manual input.

 
3) Multi-Language Translation: Supports translation of detected text into multiple languages.

   
4) Text-to-Speech Integration: Converts translated text into speech, allowing for easy communication in the selected language.

 
5) Customizable Language Selection: Users can choose from a variety of languages for translation and speech output.

 
This tool aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance accessibility for individuals who use sign language.
